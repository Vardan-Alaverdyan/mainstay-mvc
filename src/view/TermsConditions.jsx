            <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p><b> 1. Intro and Acceptance.</b> <br/> CommerceBlock is pleased to offer you access to its MainStay Services.
              When we refer to our “Services” in these Terms and Conditions, we mean to include everything — our
              platform services, all of our programs, features, functions and report formats, instructions, code
              samples, on-line help files and technical documentation, our websites, account portal, technical
              support, made generally available by us, and includes any of our SDKs, APIs or software provided
              to you in connection with your use of our services, and our connectivity services. <b>“CommerceBlock,”</b>
              <b> “us,”</b> or <b> “we”</b> refers to Commerceblock Limited, incorporated in England and Wales with registered
              address at 7/10 Chandos Street, Cavendish Square, W1G 9DQ London.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read these Terms of Service (these <b>“Terms”</b>) carefully. These Terms, together with other documents we
              refer to in this document, like our Privacy Policy (collectively, the <b>“Agreement”</b> ), govern your access to
              the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                BY SIGNING UP TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT WITH US OR BY CONTINUING TO USE OUR WEBSITE YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS.
                BY DOING SO, YOU AGREE ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR, IF APPLICABLE, YOUR ORGANISATION TO BE BOUND BY THIS
                AGREEMENT AS OF THAT DATE (THE “EFFECTIVE DATE”). YOUR ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICES AND COMMERCEBLOCK’S
                OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES ARE EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED ON YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT,
                INCLUDING OUR LIMITED LIABILITY IN SECTION 15 AND ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN SECTION 19.
                IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICES.
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you create an account or otherwise use the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant
              that you have the authority to bind your organization and enter into this Agreement on its behalf.  The terms
              <b>“you”</b> and <b>“your”</b> (except for in this paragraph) will refer to that organization. If you or your organization
              has a separate written contract or license with CommerceBlock regarding the use of the Services
              (such as an enterprise agreement or a license to use any open source software we may provide),
              that contract or license (and not this Agreement) will govern your use of the applicable Services.
            </p>
            <p><b>2.Changes to These Terms.</b><br/> We may revise these Terms from time to time.  If we do, those revised
              Terms will supersede prior versions. Unless we say otherwise, revisions will be effective upon the effective
              date indicated at the top of these Terms.  We will notify you of any material revisions via the account
              portal and/or via an email to the email address we have on file. For other revisions, we will update the
              effective date of these Terms at the top of the page. We encourage you to check the effective date of
              these Terms whenever you visit CommerceBlock’s website or account portal. Your continued access or use
              of our Services after we notify you of the revisions constitutes your acceptance of those revisions.
              If you don’t agree to the revisions, you should stop using our Services and we are not obligated to
              provide you with the Services.</p>

              Services are compatible with our then-current Services. Although we try to avoid making changes to our
              Services that are not backwards compatible, if any such changes become necessary, we will use reasonable
              efforts to let you know at least sixty (60) days prior to implementing those changes.</p>

              the other party, shall not use such Confidential Information except to exercise its rights and perform
              its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third
              party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall use at least the same degree of care, but not less
              than a reasonable degree of care, it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information
              to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall promptly notify
              the other party of any actual or suspected misuse or unauthorized disclosure of the other party’s Confidential
              Information. Each party may disclose Confidential Information of the other party on a need-to-know basis to its
              employees, contractors, representatives and advisors who are subject to confidentiality agreements requiring
              them to maintain such information in confidence consistent with the terms of this Agreement and use it only
              to facilitate the performance of their services on behalf of the receiving party.
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>11.4 Exceptions. </u> The obligations related to Confidential Information in this Agreement will not apply
              to information that: (i) is known publicly at the time of the disclosure or becomes known publicly after
              disclosure through no fault of the receiving party, (ii) is known to the receiving party, without
              restriction, at the time of disclosure or becomes known to the receiving party, without restriction,
              from a source other than the disclosing party not bound by confidentiality obligations to the
              disclosing party, or (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the Confidential
              Information as demonstrated by the written records of the receiving party to the disclosing party’s
              reasonable satisfaction. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information of the other party
              to the extent such disclosure is required by law or order of a court or other governmental authority,
              provided that the receiving party shall use reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party prior
              to such disclosure to allow the disclosing party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or
              restrict such disclosure.
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>11.5 Equitable Relief.</u>  Each party agrees that the other parties may have no adequate remedy at law if
              there is a breach or threatened breach of this Section 12 and, accordingly, that the non-breaching party
              will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or remedy such a breach in addition
              to any legal remedies available to that party.

              <u>11.6 Use of Marks.</u>   Subject to this Agreement, we both grant each other the right to use and display
              each other’s name and logo (the “Licensor Marks”) on our respective websites and in other promotional
              materials solely in connection with each of our respective activities under this Agreement. All of
              this use of the Licensor Marks will be in accordance with the each other’s applicable usage guidelines
              and will inure to the benefit of the licensor and, with respect to CommerceBlock, will be subject to
              CommerceBlock’s prior written consent in each case. The one of us using the other’s Licensor Marks
              under this subsection will not use, register or take other action with respect to any of the Licensor
              Marks, except to the extent allowed in advance in writing by the one of us whose Licensor Marks are
              being used. In using the Licensor Marks under this subsection, the one of us using the other’s Licensor
              Marks will always use the then-current Licensor Marks and will not add to, delete from or modify any of
              Licensor Marks. The one of us using the other’s Licensor Marks will not, at any time, misrepresent the
              relationship between us. The one using the other’s Licensor Marks will not present itself as an affiliate
              or other legal agent of the one of us whose Licensor Marks are being used. The rights to use and display
              each other’s Licensor Marks under this subsection will end automatically in the event of termination of
              this Agreement.
